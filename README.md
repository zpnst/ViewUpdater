The program works through geckodriver and is designed to cheat views on a particular site. It was used to improve the statistics of organizations on maps.

To start using, insert files with links to an organization on maps or any other thing into the "linksfolder" directory.
You can put both individual files and one large one. The program will combine and mix everything by itself.

When starting the program, select the number of browser windows that will open at a time.

Next, the program will go to the links and wait there for a while for the transition to count.
